## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to work collaboratively in a small team to
build a project relating to the Code Institute's February Hackathon:
Valentine's - Share the love.

## Objective
Escapade is a location based dating app, designed to take away some of the pressure
users feel when trying to find a match. Rather than simply matching based on looks, Escapade
puts the focus on the location of the date. Users swipe left or right to choose their desired location,
and Escapade will match them with someone who also likes the chosen location.
Users can then chat to get to know one another before agreeing to meet.

By going through this process, users will have a common interest in the location to break the ice, and 
potentially find love, with an amazing first date story.

## User Experience

-   ### User stories

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to create a profile and enter my details
        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to to choose my the gender I identify with rather than male or female.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to login to my account and continue where I left off
        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find a match and chat to them
        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to know which locations are being used in the app

    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. As a Frequent User, I want organise a date with my match, and continue talking to them afterwards
        1. As a Frequent User, I want update my profile details
        1. As a Frequent User, I want to match and chat to several people seperately to see who I connect with

-   ### UXD User Experience Design

    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   To make the app fun and inviting, a purple gradient background is featured on all pages. with content 
            set into a translucent 
    -   #### Typography
        -   Open Sans is used for the majorty of the site for its ease of readability, to complement that and give a slight difference,
            Roboto is used for the buttons throughout the site.

### Wireframes

## Features

### Current Features

1. Create Account
- Users can click here to create a username and password for the app. Users must confirm their password to prevent mistakes. Parameters are
listed next to the relavent input for what can and cannot be used.

1. Sign in
- Users who have already made an account can sign in with their credentials and all of their chats and profile
details are saved.

1. Profile
- Users can view their current profile details, including profile pic, age, bio, relationship status etc.

1. Update Profile
- Users Can edit all of the details previously mentioned here, and save them or cancel the changes.

1. Location Match
- Users can choose from a list of locations, then see other users who have also liked that location.

1. Chat
- Once users choose who they want to chat with, a chat window will open for them to converse and organise a meetup.

### Features Left to Implement

1. The concept of this app could work in anywhere in the world, and could be limited to a single city, with the location options
    being a restaurant or park. For this reason, it would be helpful to have images displaying as well as the location name, so users
    can get a feel for the places they like.

1. With this in mind, users could also rate the locations for other users to see and make a decision based on this.

1. When matching with a person, it could be useful to have the other user's profile picture appear. Currently the app works as a blind date
    type thing, but matching a picture to a name would make users feel more secure.

1. A report button for users to give feedback on other negative users. This can then be investigated through chat logs and users can be removed
    if necessary.

## Testing

### Manual Testing

Thorough manual testing was done throughout the development of the app to ensure that any new features were not
negatively impacting the rest of the site.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, and Safari on iOS and iPadOS.
-   The website was tested on Chrome, Safari and Firefox on laptop and desktop.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPad, iPad Pro, iPhone7, iPhone X, iPhone SE & iPhone 12.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
-   I tested the page using GoogleDev Tools Lighthouse feature on both mobile and desktop settings
