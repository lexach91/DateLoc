## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to work collaboratively in a small team to
build a project relating to the Code Institute's February Hackathon:
Valentine's - Share the love.

## Objective
Escapade is a location based dating app, designed to take away some of the pressure
users feel when trying to find a match. Rather than simply matching based on looks, Escapade
puts the focus on the location of the date. Users swipe left or right to choose their desired location,
and Escapade will match them with someone who also likes the chosen location.
Users can then chat to get to know one another before agreeing to meet.

By going through this process, users will have a common interest in the location to break the ice, and 
potentially find love, with an amazing first date story.
